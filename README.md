# hexagram30/dice

*An entropy manager, random number generator/seed tracker, and dice-roller for hexagram30 projects*

[![][logo]][logo-large]


## About

The dice app defines a `random` system component which is designed for use by
all hexagram30 applications for its random number generation. The `random`
component does not use Clojure's default support for random (i.e.,
`java.util.Random`), but rather `java.security.SecureRandom` and as such is
suitable for use in powering in-game economic computations.


## Usage

### CLI

This project specifically offers a secure random service as well as various
core functionalities that utilize this service, in particular, the dice-rolling
service. The CLI support of thre service has been moved to the repository for
the `hxgm30` CLI executable. For dice roller usage, see the 
[hxgm30 README](https://github.com/hexagram30/cli#dice-roller).

### From the REPL

First, we need to start the system:

```clj
[hxgm30.dice.repl] λ=> (startup)
```

With the standard output of:

```
2020-01-01T02:13:18.902 [nREPL-worker-0] INFO hxgm30.dice.components.config:61 - Starting config component ...
2020-01-01T02:13:18.970 [nREPL-worker-0] INFO hxgm30.dice.components.logging:22 - Starting logging component ...
2020-01-01T02:13:18.974 [nREPL-worker-0] INFO hxgm30.dice.components.random:71 - Starting random component ...
2020-01-01T02:13:19.261 [nREPL-worker-0] INFO hxgm30.dice.components.grpcd:51 - Starting dice gRPC server component on port 2344...
:running

```

Now we can use the system-based `random` API:

```clj
[hxgm30.dice.repl] λ=> (random/int (system))
26506698
[hxgm30.dice.repl] λ=> (random/int (system) 100)
97
[hxgm30.dice.repl] λ=> (random/float (system))
0.59698063
[hxgm30.dice.repl] λ=> (random/double (system))
0.2833395304088826
[hxgm30.dice.repl] λ=> (random/long (system))
5481343508301620380
[hxgm30.dice.repl] λ=> (random/bigint (system))
-6431860707905474045N
[hxgm30.dice.repl] λ=> (random/bigdec (system))
0.6297262833005943M
[hxgm30.dice.repl] λ=> (random/nth (system) [:alice :bob :carol :dave :eve :fred])
:fred
```

And the `dice` (`hxgm30.dice.core`) API:

```clj
[hxgm30.dice.repl] λ=> (dice/d4 (system))
2
[hxgm30.dice.repl] λ=> (dice/d6 (system))
5
[hxgm30.dice.repl] λ=> (dice/d8 (system))
7
[hxgm30.dice.repl] λ=> (dice/d10 (system))
9
[hxgm30.dice.repl] λ=> (dice/d12 (system))
12
[hxgm30.dice.repl] λ=> (dice/d20 (system))
17
[hxgm30.dice.repl] λ=> (dice/d100 (system))
74
```

You can also make multiple roles:

```clj
[hxgm30.dice.repl] λ=> (dice/d6 (system) 3)
[2 1 2]
[hxgm30.dice.repl] λ=> (dice/d20 (system) 4)
[7 19 16 13]
```


Note that d10 has a special case: if you roll two, the value is interpretted as
a value between 1 and 100 (inclusive). However, it doesn't do this by calling
d100; it really rolls two d10 and assembles the resulting values:

```clj
[hxgm30.dice.repl] λ=> (dice/d10 (system) 2)
67
```

Finally, there is a `roll` function where you can specify the types and number
of die, just like with the command line tool:

```clj
[hxgm30.dice.repl] λ=> (dice/roll (system) :d10 2 :d20 5 :d4 6 :d8 2 :d10 2 :d10 4 :d100 1 :d12 3)

Results:

d10:
    47 24 [9 6 9 7]
d20:
    [8 9 16 8 7]
d4:
    [4 2 3 4 1 1]
d8:
    [4 5]
d100:
    78
d12:
    [10 11 6]


:ok
```

The results are presented in the same order as they are entered.

Note that this API is a wrapper for the more data-oriented `hxgm30.dice.roller`
API. The differences are most obvious when doing multiple rolls at
once:

```clj
(roller/roll (system) {:d10 2 :d20 5 :d4 6 :d8 2 :d100 1 :d12 3})
[47 [9 2 2 5 3] [2 3 4 2 1 3] [1 1] 81 [9 8 9]]
```

Some functions are only available in the `roller` API ...

For larger roll counts, the `stats` function maybe be useful:

```clj
[hxgm30.dice.repl] λ=> (def rs (dice/d6 (system) 10))
[hxgm30.dice.repl] λ=> rs
[2 6 5 3 6 1 5 2 5 6]
[hxgm30.dice.repl] λ=> (dice/stats rs)
{:avg 4.1 :high 6 :low 1 :sum 41}
```

The stats may also be returned when doing multiple roles with the
`metaroll` function:
```clj
[hxgm30.dice.repl] λ=> (roller/roll-meta (system) {:d4 20 :d6 12 :d8 18 :d20 1})
[{:rolls [1 1 1 2 2 1 3 2 2 2 3 4 2 3 4 2 3 4 2 4]
  :stats {:avg 2.4 :high 4 :low 1 :sum 48}}
 {:rolls [1 5 3 6 4 2 1 5 5 2 5 1]
  :stats {:avg 3.3333333 :high 6 :low 1 :sum 40}}
 {:rolls [3 2 5 6 6 1 8 2 6 7 5 7 7 3 7 5 7 8]
  :stats {:avg 5.2777777 :high 8 :low 1 :sum 95}}
 {:roll 8}]
```
